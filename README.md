# Gun-Boot - A Vertical Platformer

A challenging vertical platformer game where you use "gun-boots" to shoot downward and navigate through procedurally generated platforms.

## Game Features

### Core Mechanics
- Jump from platform to platform as you descend
- Mid-air gun-boot shooting that can both kill enemies and provide upward momentum
- Limited ammo that recharges when standing on platforms

### Platforms & Procedural Generation
- Randomly generated platforms as you descend
- Varying platform widths and positions
- Occasional vertical shafts with no platforms that require gun-boot braking
- Dynamic gap sizes and platform densities for fresh runs

### Enemies & Hazards
- Turret-like enemies that shoot projectiles at you
- Defeat enemies by shooting them or jumping on their heads
- Enemies sometimes drop point pickups when defeated

### Health & Scoring
- Four-hit health system displayed at the top of the screen
- Current ammo count displayed (0-8)
- Score increases based on depth traveled and enemies defeated

### Pacing & Feel
- Fall speed gradually accelerates as you survive longer
- Sound effects for shooting and landing provide tactile feedback

## Controls
